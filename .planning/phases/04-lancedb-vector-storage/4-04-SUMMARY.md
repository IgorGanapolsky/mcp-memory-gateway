decisions:
  - prove-lancedb.js uses RLHF_VECTOR_STUB_EMBED=true for deterministic offline smoke test — mirrors test pattern from 4-03
  - VEC-02 evidence: grep scripts/vector-store.js for "await import(" at specific line numbers — concrete file+line reference
  - VEC-03 evidence: parse apache-arrow version from package.json and verify <= 18.1.0 ceiling programmatically
  - VEC-04 smoke: runs two upserts then searches; verifies both records returned; warns (not fails) on network/ONNX errors
  - VEC-05 self-referential: execSync node --test tests/vector-store.test.js inside proof script; passes iff 4+ tests pass

# Phase 4 Plan 04: LanceDB Proof Report Generation Summary

Phase gate proof script generating lancedb-report.md with per-requirement evidence for VEC-01..VEC-05 via real LanceDB smoke test (upsertFeedback + searchSimilar in tmpdir) plus package.json inspection and node:test execution.

## What Was Built

### Task 1: scripts/prove-lancedb.js

Proof script following the prove-adapters.js pattern:

1. **VEC-01 smoke test** — creates tmpdir, sets `RLHF_FEEDBACK_DIR` and `RLHF_VECTOR_STUB_EMBED=true`, invalidates `require.cache`, calls `upsertFeedback()` then `searchSimilar()`, verifies lancedb dir created and record returned.
2. **VEC-02 evidence** — reads `scripts/vector-store.js`, greps for `await import(` occurrences, reports exact file + line numbers for both `@lancedb/lancedb` and `@huggingface/transformers` dynamic imports.
3. **VEC-03 evidence** — parses `apache-arrow` version from `package.json`, verifies `<= 18.1.0` constraint programmatically.
4. **VEC-04 evidence** — second search call with two records in the store, verifies both IDs returned. Network/ONNX errors are `warn` (not `fail`).
5. **VEC-05 self-referential** — runs `node --test tests/vector-store.test.js` via `execSync`, parses pass/fail counts, verifies >= 4 passing + 0 failing.
6. Writes `proof/lancedb-report.md` (human-readable) and `proof/lancedb-report.json` (machine-readable).
7. Exits 0 if no `fail` statuses; exits 1 if any `fail`.

### Task 2: Full test suite verification

`npm test` passed: 93 node-runner tests + 2 proof tests, 0 failures, 0 regressions.

`REQUIREMENTS.md` was already updated by prior plans (4-01 through 4-03) with all VEC requirements marked `[x]` complete.

## Verification Evidence

```
npm run prove:lancedb

Proof written to proof/lancedb-report.md
           and   proof/lancedb-report.json
{
  "passed": 5,
  "failed": 0,
  "warned": 0
}
PASS — all requirements satisfied (warns are acceptable).

npm test → 93 pass, 0 fail
node --test tests/vector-store.test.js → 4 pass, 0 fail

grep -c "VEC-0[1-5]" proof/lancedb-report.md → 11
grep "\[x\].*VEC" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md | wc -l → 5
```

## Proof Report Results

| Requirement | Status | Summary |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| VEC-01 | PASS | lancedb dir created; upsertFeedback()+searchSimilar() round-trip succeeds |
| VEC-02 | PASS | dynamic import() at line 16 (@lancedb/lancedb) and line 23 (@huggingface/transformers) |
| VEC-03 | PASS | apache-arrow="^18.1.0" confirmed <= 18.1.0 ceiling; LanceDB 0.26.2 peer dep satisfied |
| VEC-04 | PASS | searchSimilar() returns 2 results after 2 upserts; both IDs present |
| VEC-05 | PASS | node --test tests/vector-store.test.js: pass=4, fail=0; delta >= 4 from Phase 3 baseline |

## Test Count History

| Baseline (Phase 1) | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 4 | Total |
|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| 60 | +29 ML tests | +4 proof tests | +4 vector-store tests | 93 |

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

REQUIREMENTS.md was already marked complete by prior plans (4-01 through 4-03 each updated their respective requirements), so Task 2 had no file changes to commit.

## Self-Check

- [x] `scripts/prove-lancedb.js` exists and runs
- [x] `proof/lancedb-report.md` exists with 5 VEC rows
- [x] `proof/lancedb-report.json` exists
- [x] `npm run prove:lancedb` in package.json
- [x] `npm test` passes 93 + 2 tests
- [x] All 5 VEC requirements `[x]` in REQUIREMENTS.md
- [x] commit 9778aaf: feat(04-04): add prove-lancedb.js proof script and generate lancedb-report.md
