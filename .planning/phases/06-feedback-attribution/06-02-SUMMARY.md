# Phase 06 Plan 02: Hybrid Feedback Context — Pre-Tool Guard Engine Summary

**One-liner:** Pre-tool guard engine with compiled artifact fast path — block/warn/allow decisions derived from attributed feedback JSONL, enforcing ATTR-03 no-false-positive invariant via two-keyword match and count >= 2 filter.

## What Was Built

`scripts/hybrid-feedback-context.js` (676 lines, CJS) — the pre-tool execution guard that:

1. Reads from 4 JSONL sources: feedback-log, inbox, pending_cortex_sync, attributed-feedback
2. Deduplicates entries by id, builds recurring negative patterns (count >= 2)
3. Compiles patterns into a fast guard artifact (`pretool-guards.json`) via `compileGuardArtifact()`
4. Evaluates pre-tool calls: compiled artifact path first, live state fallback
5. Returns `{mode: 'block'|'warn'|'allow', reason, source}` — never blocks on no prior data

## Exports Verified

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `buildHybridState(opts)` | Reads all 4 JSONL sources, deduplicates, builds state |
| `evaluatePretool(toolName, toolInput, opts)` | Orchestrates compiled → state fallback |
| `compileGuardArtifact(state, opts)` | Builds deduped guards array from state |
| `writeGuardArtifact(filePath, artifact)` | Atomic write via tmp rename |
| `readGuardArtifact(filePath)` | Reads + validates guards array |
| `evaluateCompiledGuards(artifact, toolName, toolInput)` | Fast path check |
| `evaluatePretoolFromState(state, toolName, toolInput)` | Live path check |
| `deriveConstraints(state, max)` | Produces up to 5 actionable constraint strings |
| `buildAdditionalContext(state, constraints, maxChars)` | Formats summary for pre-tool injection |

## Verification Evidence

```
# All 5 plan verification steps passed:
node -e "require('./scripts/hybrid-feedback-context')"         → no error
evaluatePretool('Read','never-seen').mode === 'allow'          → true
buildHybridState().counts.total === number                     → true
grep "attributedFeedback" scripts/hybrid-feedback-context.js  → PATHS key + preferred strategy confirmed
node scripts/hybrid-feedback-context.js --compile-guards /tmp → {"guardCount":0,"outPath":...}
```

## CLI Behavior

- `--pretool <toolName> <toolInputJson>` — exits 2 on block, 0 on allow/warn
- `--compile-guards [outPath]` — writes guard artifact, outputs JSON summary
- Default — prints full state + constraints + additional context

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written. Subway source did not exist as a physical file (find returned nothing), so the module was implemented from scratch following the detailed spec in 06-02-PLAN.md. All behavioral invariants are preserved.
