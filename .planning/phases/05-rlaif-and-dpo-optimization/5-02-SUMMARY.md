# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 02-ml-into-rlhf-feedback-loop
    provides: inferDomain() in feedback-loop.js, timeDecayWeight() in thompson-sampling.js, memory-log.jsonl data format
  - phase: 01-contract-alignment
    provides: parseTimestamp() in feedback-schema.js
provides:
  - extractMetaPolicyRules() — reads memory-log.jsonl, groups by inferDomain(), computes recency-weighted confidence + trend
  - run() — writes meta-policy-rules.json to RLHF_FEEDBACK_DIR
  - ml:meta-policy npm script
  - inferDomain export added to feedback-loop.js module.exports
affects:
  - 05-03 (dpo-optimizer needs meta-policy rules context)
  - 05-04 (prove-rlaif.js gates on extractMetaPolicyRules() smoke test)

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "Separate artifacts: meta-policy-rules.json vs prevention-rules.md serve different granularities"
    - "Synchronous run() with try/catch CLI entrypoint (no async needed for pure JSONL I/O)"
    - "Confidence formula: min(0.95, 0.4 + avg_weighted*0.3 + count*0.05) from Subway Python reference"
    - "Trend detection: improving/deteriorating/needs_attention/stable based on recent_entries vs recent_positive"

key-files:
  created:
    - scripts/meta-policy.js
  modified:
    - scripts/feedback-loop.js
    - package.json

key-decisions:
  - "inferDomain exported from feedback-loop.js — it was implemented there but not in module.exports; added as Rule 2 auto-fix"
  - "timeDecayWeight imported from thompson-sampling.js not feedback-schema.js — feedback-schema.js does not export it"
  - "run() is synchronous — CLI entrypoint uses try/catch not .catch() (plan spec was wrong about async)"
  - "inferDomain(entry.tags, entry.context) called with two args — function signature requires tags+context separately"

# Phase 5 Plan 02: Meta-Policy Rule Extraction Summary

**extractMetaPolicyRules() reads memory-log.jsonl, groups negative entries by inferDomain(), computes recency-weighted confidence scores (0-0.95) and trend direction, writes meta-policy-rules.json**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-04T20:19:22Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-04T20:20:56Z
- **Tasks:** 1 completed
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- scripts/meta-policy.js created with extractMetaPolicyRules() and run() exports
- Rules have {category, confidence, trend, occurrence_count, last_seen} as required
- Empty/missing memory-log.jsonl handled gracefully (returns [] without throwing)
- Malformed JSONL lines skipped with stderr warning
- ml:meta-policy npm script added and verified working
- inferDomain exported from feedback-loop.js (was implemented but not exported)
- All 93 existing tests continue to pass

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create meta-policy.js — rule extraction from memory-log.jsonl trends** - `538cbdf` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `scripts/meta-policy.js` - extractMetaPolicyRules() + run() exports; CLI entrypoint with --extract flag
- `scripts/feedback-loop.js` - Added inferDomain to module.exports (required for import)
- `package.json` - Added ml:meta-policy script

## Decisions Made

- inferDomain imported from feedback-loop.js per plan requirement; needed to be added to module.exports first
- timeDecayWeight imported from thompson-sampling.js (not feedback-schema.js — feedback-schema.js confirmed not to export it)
- run() implemented as synchronous; CLI entrypoint wraps with try/catch rather than .catch() since no promises involved
- inferDomain(entry.tags, entry.context) called with two separate args matching the actual function signature

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Missing Export] inferDomain not exported from feedback-loop.js**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (creating meta-policy.js)
- **Issue:** Plan requires `const { inferDomain } = require('./feedback-loop')` but inferDomain was implemented at line 135 without being added to module.exports
- **Fix:** Added `inferDomain` to the module.exports object in feedback-loop.js
- **Files modified:** scripts/feedback-loop.js
- **Verification:** `const { inferDomain } = require('./feedback-loop')` in meta-policy.js resolves correctly
- **Committed in:** 538cbdf (Task 1 commit)

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] CLI entrypoint run().catch() fails — run() is synchronous**
- **Found during:** Task 1 verification (`npm run ml:meta-policy`)
- **Issue:** Plan spec said `run().catch(e => ...)` but run() returns a plain object, not a Promise — `.catch is not a function` error
- **Fix:** Changed CLI entrypoint to `try { run(); } catch (e) { ... }` — synchronous error handling
- **Files modified:** scripts/meta-policy.js
- **Verification:** `npm run ml:meta-policy` exits 0 with `meta-policy: extracted 0 rules`
- **Committed in:** 538cbdf (Task 1 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 2 auto-fixed (1 missing export, 1 bug)
**Impact on plan:** Both fixes necessary for correct operation. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

None beyond the two auto-fixed deviations above.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- DPO-03 complete: extractMetaPolicyRules() and run() both verified working
- inferDomain is now exported from feedback-loop.js — other Phase 5 modules can also use it
- meta-policy-rules.json output confirmed: {generated, rules[]} structure with category/confidence/trend/occurrence_count/last_seen
- Phase 5 plans 5-03 (dpo-optimizer) and 5-04 (prove-rlaif) can proceed
