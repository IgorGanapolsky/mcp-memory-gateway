# Phase 2 Plan 04: Sequence Tracking and Diversity Tracking Tests Summary

TDD test suites for ML-03 sequence tracking and ML-04 diversity tracking — 16 new node:test assertions covering file creation, schema correctness, reward signs, edge cases, and tmpdir isolation.

## Tasks Completed

| # | Name | Commit | Key Files |
|---|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Create feedback-sequences.test.js and diversity-tracking.test.js | 63c4374 | tests/feedback-sequences.test.js, tests/diversity-tracking.test.js |
| 2 | Add new test files to test:api and verify full npm test suite | 4756dcc | package.json |

## Verification Evidence

```
node --test tests/feedback-sequences.test.js
  ✔ accepted captureFeedback() creates feedback-sequences.jsonl
  ✔ sequence entry has correct schema
  ✔ targetReward is 1 for positive signal
  ✔ targetReward is -1 for negative signal
  ✔ features.rewardSequence is an array
  ✔ features.tagFrequency is an object
  ✔ rejected captureFeedback() does NOT create sequence entry
  ✔ multiple accepted calls append multiple sequence entries
  tests 8 | pass 8 | fail 0

node --test tests/diversity-tracking.test.js
  ✔ accepted captureFeedback() creates diversity-tracking.json
  ✔ diversity-tracking.json has diversityScore field
  ✔ diversityScore is a numeric value in [0, 100]
  ✔ domains object is populated
  ✔ domain count matches feedback domain (testing tag -> testing domain)
  ✔ lastUpdated is set
  ✔ diversityScore updates after second feedback with different domain
  ✔ diversityScore is not NaN or Infinity on first entry (edge case)
  tests 8 | pass 8 | fail 0

npm test (full suite)
  test:api node-runner: tests 89 | pass 89 | fail 0
  (baseline was 60 — 89 > 60 confirmed)
  All suites exit 0.
```

## Decisions Made

1. `require.cache` invalidation per test — each `it` block deletes the feedback-loop module from cache before re-requiring so that `process.env.RLHF_FEEDBACK_DIR` changes are picked up fresh.
2. The diversity "first entry edge case" test (pitch#8 in Research) uses its own `mkdtempSync` fresh directory to guarantee no pre-existing `diversity-tracking.json` exists, avoiding pollution from the `before()` block.
3. `thompson-sampling.test.js` was already in the test:api list from plan 02-03 execution. New files were appended after it without reordering.

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- tests/feedback-sequences.test.js: FOUND
- tests/diversity-tracking.test.js: FOUND
- package.json updated: CONFIRMED (tests/feedback-sequences.test.js and tests/diversity-tracking.test.js present in test:api)
- Commits 63c4374 and 4756dcc: CONFIRMED
- npm test exit 0: CONFIRMED (89 node-runner tests, all passing)
