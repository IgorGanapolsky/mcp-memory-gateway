# Phase 02 Plan 03: Thompson Sampling TDD Test Suite Summary

**One-liner:** node:test suite for Beta-Bernoulli Thompson Sampling — 15 tests covering timeDecayWeight, createInitialModel, updateModel, getReliability, samplePosteriors, and loadModel against the Plan 01 implementation.

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | RED — Write failing tests for Thompson Sampling | 2a4ff79 | tests/thompson-sampling.test.js |
| 2 | GREEN — Add tests to test runner and verify full suite | (pkg.json already updated) | package.json |

## Verification Evidence

```
node --test tests/thompson-sampling.test.js
ℹ tests 15
ℹ pass 15
ℹ fail 0
ℹ duration_ms 175.253875

npm test
test:schema: 7 passed
test:loop: 10 passed
test:dpo: 6 passed
test:api: 73 passed (node-runner)
test:proof: 2 passed
Total: 73 node-runner tests (Phase 1 baseline was 60 — delta +13)
```

## Test Coverage

| Describe Block | Tests | Behaviors Covered |
|---|---|---|
| timeDecayWeight | 5 | fresh (~1.0), 7d (~0.5), invalid string, null, 365d floor |
| createInitialModel | 1 | all DEFAULT_CATEGORIES alpha=1/beta=1/samples=0 |
| updateModel | 5 | positive alpha++, negative beta++, empty->uncategorized, auto-create, total_entries |
| getReliability | 1 | alpha/(alpha+beta) = 0.75 for alpha=3/beta=1 |
| samplePosteriors | 1 | all values in [0,1] after 5 updates |
| loadModel | 2 | missing file -> initial model, reads existing file via tmpdir |

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written. Tests were GREEN immediately (not RED-then-GREEN) because thompson-sampling.js was already implemented in Plan 01. This is the expected TDD flow for a plan explicitly targeting "write tests that define expected behavior, verify they pass against Plan 01's implementation."

## Requirements Satisfied

- ML-01: Beta-Bernoulli posterior sampling tested via samplePosteriors and getReliability
- ML-02: Time-decay weighting tested via timeDecayWeight (fresh, 7d, invalid, floor)
- ML-05: Unit tests proving correct Thompson Sampling and time-decay behavior — COMPLETE

## Self-Check

- [x] tests/thompson-sampling.test.js exists (167 lines, 15 tests, 6 describe blocks)
- [x] Commit 2a4ff79 exists in git log
- [x] thompson-sampling.test.js in package.json test:api command
- [x] npm test exits 0 with 73 node-runner tests (> 60 baseline)
