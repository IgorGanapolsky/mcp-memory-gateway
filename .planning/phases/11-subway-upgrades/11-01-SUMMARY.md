# Phase 11 Plan 01: LanceDB Vector Store Port to Subway Summary

Ported rlhf's vector-store.js to Subway's .claude/scripts/feedback/ with 3-level path adjustment and Jest tests.

## What Was Built

`Subway/.claude/scripts/feedback/vector-store.js` — LanceDB vector store port:
- Identical API to rlhf: `upsertFeedback(event)`, `searchSimilar(query, limit)`, `TABLE_NAME`
- PATH fix: PROJECT_ROOT uses 3 levels up (not 1 level as in rlhf)
- Stub embed: RLHF_VECTOR_STUB_EMBED=true for Jest test isolation

`Subway/scripts/__tests__/vector-store.test.js` — 6 Jest tests:
- TABLE_NAME equals 'rlhf_memories'
- upsertFeedback creates LanceDB table on first upsert
- upsertFeedback adds to existing table on second upsert
- searchSimilar returns empty array when no data
- searchSimilar returns results after upsert
- loads without error in stub mode

## Deviations from Plan

**[Rule 2 - Missing Critical]** Added `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules` to Subway's test:governance script in package.json — required for dynamic import() in Jest

## Self-Check: PASSED

- Subway/vector-store.js: EXISTS
- Subway/vector-store.test.js: EXISTS (6 tests, 0 failures)
- prove-subway-upgrades.js SUBW-01: PASS
